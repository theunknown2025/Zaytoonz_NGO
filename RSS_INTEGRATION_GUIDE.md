- Ensure the URL is accessible and contains content
- Some sites block automated access
- Try a different URL or contact RSS.app support

**"No items found in RSS feed"**
- New feeds may take time to populate
- Try refreshing the feed after a few minutes
- Check if the original website has recent content

**API Rate Limits**
- RSS.app has rate limits on free accounts
- Consider upgrading for higher limits
- Implement retry logic for production use

### Debug Mode

To debug RSS integration:

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Look at network requests in DevTools
3. Verify API responses in the Network tab

## üìà Best Practices

### Feed Management
1. **Use Descriptive Titles**: Name feeds clearly (e.g., "Tech Jobs - Company X")
2. **Regular Cleanup**: Delete unused feeds to stay within limits
3. **Monitor Performance**: Check feed update frequency

### Job Import Strategy
1. **Batch Imports**: Import from multiple feeds at once
2. **Regular Schedule**: Set up a routine for checking new jobs
3. **Quality Control**: Review imported jobs before saving to database

### Performance Optimization
1. **Limit Items**: Don't import too many jobs at once
2. **Cache Results**: Use local storage for temporary results
3. **Error Handling**: Handle API failures gracefully
