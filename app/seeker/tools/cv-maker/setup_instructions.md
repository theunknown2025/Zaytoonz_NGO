# CV Maker Database Setup Instructions

## 1. Database Setup

### Run SQL Schema
Execute the `sql_setup.sql` file in your Supabase SQL editor to create all necessary tables:

1. Open your Supabase project dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `sql_setup.sql`
4. Run the SQL script

This will create:
- `cvs` - Main CV table with general info
- `cv_work_experiences` - Work experience entries
- `cv_education` - Education entries  
- `cv_skills` - Skills with proficiency levels
- `cv_languages` - Languages with proficiency levels
- `cv_certificates` - Certificates and certifications
- `cv_projects` - Project entries

## 2. Environment Variables

Ensure your `.env.local` file contains:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

## 3. Features Implemented

### ✅ Database Storage
- CVs are now saved to Supabase instead of localStorage
- Full relational database structure with proper foreign keys
- Automatic timestamps for created_at and updated_at

### ✅ CRUD Operations
- **Create**: Save new CVs with all sections
- **Read**: Load saved CVs with full data
- **Update**: Modify existing CVs
- **Delete**: Remove CVs and all related data

### ✅ User Experience
- Loading states for all database operations
- Toast notifications for success/error feedback
- Proper error handling and user feedback

## 4. Migration Notes

### Removed Features
- ❌ localStorage dependency completely removed
- ❌ Date.now() ID generation replaced with UUID
- ❌ Manual JSON stringification replaced with proper database relations

### Data Structure Changes
- IDs changed from `number` to `string` (UUID)
- Date fields properly typed as DATE in database
- Sections stored as PostgreSQL arrays
- General info stored as JSONB for flexibility

## 5. User Authentication

Currently using a temporary user ID (`temp_user_001`) for all CVs. When you implement proper authentication:

1. Replace `TEMP_USER_ID` in `supabaseService.ts` with actual user ID
2. Update RLS policies to filter by authenticated user
3. Add user context to all CV operations

## 6. Testing

After setup, test the following:
1. Create a new CV and save it
2. Load an existing CV
3. Rename a CV
4. Delete a CV
5. Export a CV (should work with database-stored data)

All operations should show proper loading states and success/error messages.
